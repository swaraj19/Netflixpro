Netflix Data: Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization (Beginner ML Project)
This project involves loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from a Netflix
dataset. We'll use Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to work
through the project. The goal is to explore the dataset, derive insights, and prepare
for potential machine learning tasks.
